h1. Paperclip S3 Storage

This gem will force paperclip to store attachments on S3 if your application is in production. It's great for "Heroku":http://heroku.com apps.

h1. Important Notes

If you're in fact using "Heroku":http://heroku.com, and you want the attachments to have custom paths. *PLEASE* do not use *RAILS_ROOT*. Why? Every time you deploy your app to "Heroku":http://heroku.com, you're changing the RAILS_ROOT, so all your uploaded files will be lost and your bucket *WILL* be a mess!

A default, Heroku-working path is on by default, so you can just use it.

h1. How to Use

This gem will read your S3 credentials from the server's environment. You will need to provide a secret key, an access key and a bucket. (You can provide an *_s3_credentials_* hash options with *_access_key_id_* and *_secret_access_key_* instead.)

If you are using "Heroku":http://heroku.com, it's really easy to do this, just

<pre>
  heroku config:add S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
  heroku config:add S3_KEY=your_access_key
  heroku config:add S3_SECRET=your_secret_key
</pre>

Ok, if you're really lazy, you can do that in one line:

<pre>
  heroku config:add S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name S3_KEY=your_access_key S3_SECRET=your_secret_key
</pre>

After you've done this, you can use paperclip normally. The gem just extends this methods and changes the options to force the S3 Storage. You can *even* use the same options (like path, default_style, etc.)
